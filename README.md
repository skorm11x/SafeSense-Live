# SafeSense-Live
Realtime impact sensing. 

#General Description 
Program designed to show graphs of football helmets and assist in concussion detection. Node.js Application integrating with Zigbee Module.

#Future Upgrades in order:
1. UI upgrade
2. Finish out test data mode with high school football team test data
3. Configure Zigbee and server.js for multiple helmet connections
4. Probably implement Interquartile based "filtering" to address baseline ADC value shift over longterm helmet wearing
(as person wears helmet the capacitive touch head mesh values shift slightly but remain gaussian).
5. Further development of concussion algorithm
6. Integrate 3D model and access Gyro data from Embedded Board.
